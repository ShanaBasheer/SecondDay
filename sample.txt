--new branch creation
1.git branch branch-name (ex: about-page -working based or updation based giving branch-name )
2.git status --view all status

1. git checkout master --(switched to master

i want to create new branch and at a time switch  use this cccc
 1.git checkout -b branch-name
 view all branch
 2. git branch
 view all logs
 1. git logs

 (note that each commit have one unique id is good for developers .this is main advantage for developers in any case our code is error please select previous commit id and switch 
 )
